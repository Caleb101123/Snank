Temporary Name 'Snank'
Design Notes - Final Slice

Basic gameplay is derived from classic game Snake. Player character is controlled with A & D keys for steering.
As time goes on, the player goes from green (healthy) to red (defeated). To recover, they must run into 
collectables which reset the timer. Should the player turn fully red, the game is lost and they are shown their
final score. The goal is to gain as high a score as possible before this occurs.

Game can be paused with Space or P. This also displays some player stats; such as score, speed, and timer length.
Perks acquired every 10 collectables acquired. 3 perks are chosen at random to pick from using the mouse. Negative
perks also increase the amount of points earned per collectable. Functionality for some perks to be repeatable and
others to only be acquirable a set number of times (disappearing from the pool after collection until removed from 
player). Acquired perks shown in a list upon death.


Can quit game with Esc or Q. Can restart game with R.

Post-Mortem

Honestly, I think this game was hard-carried by the simple concept. It turned out to be surprisingly fun, and make it easy to build out.
Perk system turned out to be a great idea, thanks again to Professor Hisham for the idea. Randomized run progression added replayibility
without requiring much work to extend once the original framework was in place.

Biggest challenge was aesthetics and polish. My own lack of artistic confidence held the game in a very 'placeholder graphics' state for
most of production. Best solutions going forward are to either arrange for another party to handle such things (if possible), or come up
with a simple end look that doesn't require more than basic shapes.

Also, need to remember to keep scheduling in mind. Almost ran in to deadline issues a few times due to losing track, and risking disaster
due to last-minute coding. Things turned out pretty alright this time, but could have been bad if something went wrong. Similarly, make sure
to check in with possible playtesters more often to get feedback faster for iteration; lost time waiting for feedback from friends who 
hadn't gotten around to actually trying builds a couple times.

Overall, awkward project management saved by simple concept and understanding of how to code. And lots of help from others in terms of
feedback (and coding assistance from Prof - Thanks again!).
