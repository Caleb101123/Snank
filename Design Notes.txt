Temporary Name 'Snank'
Design Notes

Basic gameplay is derived from classic game Snake. Player character is controlled with A & D keys for steering.
As time goes on, the player goes from green (healthy) to red (defeated). To recover, they must run into 
collectables which reset the timer. Should the player turn fully red, the game is lost and they are shown their
final score. The goal is to gain as high a score as possible before this occurs.

Going Forward
-Test minor variation to timer system
-Save high scores
-Add random perks, selected at intervals to modify the gameplay
-Replace visual assets
-Add sound
-Miscellaneous UX (Menus, Pausing, Options, etc)

Stretch Ideas
-Alternate gameplay modes (Increased turn rate and slower ramping of speed, but oob is loss instead of wrap?)
-Customize icons
-Proper scoreboard with 'enter your name'
